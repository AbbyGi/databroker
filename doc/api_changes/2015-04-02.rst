=========================
Removed "Scan" from __all__.  One of the users on XPD was using it by accident.
A more well-articulated reason is written by @danielballan on github regarding
this PR and the rationale:

Scan does not have interaction with Olog, and the only thing is
does with trajectories is check that they are within the bounds of the
positions. Kevin used it by mistake, and obviously wasted some time, so
@dchabot, @ericdill, and I think it muddies the waters.
